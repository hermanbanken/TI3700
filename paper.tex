\begin{abstract}
Multi-tenancy allows multiple organizations to use a single application with their own configuration, on the same system. Despite many authors have researched multi-tenancy, no clear definition exists.

In our survey, we research the current state of multi-tenancy. We identified four major software concepts that need extra care or provide extra opportunities in multi-tenant application development: 
security, as it is the security concerns holding back adoption of multi-tenancy; % Loopt nog niet helemaal soepel..
scalability, as ; 			% onliner, why difficult/challaging
quality of service, as ; 	%oneliner, why difficult/important
and variability, as that's where value is added for tenants.  

Our Research~Agenda provides an overview of possible research opportunities,

\section{Introduction}
Due to the uprising of cloud services, more and more applications are converted into multi-tenancy applications. 
This allows multiple organizations with multiple users to use the same application, and allows application providers to achieve better economies of scale. 
There is however not an explicit relationship between multi-tenancy and the cloud, since there are single-tenant cloud applications and vice versa. 
Additionally, multi-tenant applications pose new challenges, for example in terms of security and scalability. 
This literature survey merges the information of about 50 papers, in order to create a clear view of the definitions of multi-tenancy, the challenges and the research opportunities.

This survey continues with some background information on multi-tenancy in Section~\ref{sec:bg}. Thereafter, the most common challenges for multi-tenancy will be discussed: security (Section~\ref{sec:security}), scalability (Section~\ref{sec:scalability}), \ac{QoS} (Section~\ref{sec:qos}) and variability (Section~\ref{sec:variability}). After these challenges, we discuss the research opportunities in Section~\ref{sec:ra} and we conclude the survey in Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}. % Moet hier nog een waarom bij? Nee toch?

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper we surveyed the current state of multi-tenancy research.
We have identified several topics for further research on the subjects of security, scalability, quality of service and variability.

\highlight{Belangrijkste research agenda punten}
\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Automation}. 
To exploit economies of scale, providers of multi-tenant applications want to attract as many tenants and users as possible. 
However managing all these tenants and their configuration, takes a lot of time without the proper tools. 
Research has been done on creating wizards for tenants~\cite{mietzner2008generation,mietzner2008defining}, but this field is not completely covered yet and additionally, automatic deployment of the outcome of these wizards can be researched. 
\item \textbf{Guarantees}. 
In all aspects of multi-tenancy new problems arise. 
The solutions proposed for these problems need to be provable, for multi-tenancy to be usable in high availability or business critical applications. 
Open research opportunities lie in state consistency while updating the platform (Section ~\ref{sec:var_agenda}), proving data isolation between tenants (Section \highlight{hebben we dit ergens?}), providing performance isolation and minimal performance (Section \highlight{hebben we dit ergens?}).
