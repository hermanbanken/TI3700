\begin{abstract}
Multi-tenancy allows multiple organizations to use a single application with their own configuration, on the same system. Despite many authors have researched multi-tenancy, no clear definition exists.

In our survey, we research the current state of multi-tenancy. We identified four major software concepts that need extra care or provide extra opportunities in multi-tenant application development: 
security, as the security concerns are holding back adoption of multi-tenancy; 
scalability, as an unscalable application cannot leverage the benefits of the economics of scale; 
quality of service, as performance must be upheld for all active tenants;
and variability, as that's where value is added for tenants.  

Our Research~Agenda provides an overview of possible research opportunities,

\section{Introduction}
Due to the uprising of cloud services, more and more applications are converted into multi-tenancy applications. 
This allows multiple organizations with multiple users to use the same application, and allows application providers to achieve better economies of scale. 
There is however not an explicit relationship between multi-tenancy and the cloud, since there are single-tenant cloud applications and vice versa. 
Additionally, multi-tenant applications pose new challenges, for example in terms of security and scalability. 
This literature survey merges the information of about 50 papers, in order to create a clear view of the definitions of multi-tenancy, the challenges and the research opportunities.

This survey continues with some background information on multi-tenancy in Section~\ref{sec:bg}. Thereafter, the most common challenges for multi-tenancy will be discussed: security (Section~\ref{sec:security}), scalability (Section~\ref{sec:scalability}), \ac{QoS} (Section~\ref{sec:qos}) and variability (Section~\ref{sec:variability}). After these challenges we conclude the survey in Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper we surveyed the current state of multi-tenancy research.
We have identified several topics for further research on the subjects of security, scalability, quality of service and variability.

Multi-tenancy can be divided in three levels: a shared application with a separated database, a shared application with a shared database (separate schema) and a shared application with a shared schema~\cite{bezemer2010multi}. The latter is considered pure or native multi-tenancy~\cite{bezemer2010multi,lin2009feedback,aulbach2009comparison}.

The relationship between multi-tenancy and the \ac{SaaS} domain is considered close~\cite{dillon2010cloud}, or even stronger: multi-tenancy is a characteristic of the \ac{SaaS} domain~\cite{tsai2010towards}. Additionally, the challenges of cloud services overlap with the challenges of multi-tenancy~\cite{dillon2010cloud,krebs2012architecture}.

In security, a overview  has been provided of the new security concerns and their solutions introduced in multi-tenancy, including data localization, data storage and authentication and authorization. We showed that there is a thin line between security issues caused by multi-tenancy and security issues caused by the general cloud technologies. Multi-tenancy is a high-level concept, relying on a multitude of other technologies, which thereby inherits traditional security issues.  

In Scalability research on estimating resource consumption per tenant and using these estimations to place tenants within the existing infrastructure was discussed. In addition to that an overview of data layer specific scalability research was presented.

\ac{QoS} research was surveyed separately from scalability. Three techniques that use a form of per tenant request limiting for separating tenants where discussed.

In Variability, most research is done on modeling variations and describing techniques to build variants. We provided an overview of the levels of variability (e.g. external variability, visible to the customer; and internal variability, invisible to the customer), three modeling techniques (Feature modeling, Decision modeling and Orthogonal Variability modeling) and the various variation techniques.

\subsection{Research Agenda}
\label{sec:ra}
Throughout the paper we identified several research opportunities. Below we list the most prominent opportunities:
\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Automation}. 
To exploit economies of scale, providers of multi-tenant applications want to attract as many tenants and users as possible. 
However managing all these tenants and their configuration, takes a lot of time without the proper tools. 
Research has been done on creating wizards for tenants~\cite{mietzner2008generation,mietzner2008defining}, but this field is not completely covered yet and additionally, automatic deployment of the outcome of these wizards can be researched. 
\item \textbf{Guarantees}. 
In all aspects of multi-tenancy new problems arise. 
The solutions proposed for these problems need to be provable, for multi-tenancy to be usable in high availability or business critical applications. 
Open research opportunities lie in state consistency while updating the platform (Section~\ref{sec:var_agenda}), proving data isolation between tenants (Section~\ref{sec:security_agenda}), providing performance isolation and minimal performance (Section~\ref{sec:qos_agenda}).
\item \textbf{Effective security}.
Although security measures have been proposed to secure multi-tenant systems, research should dedicated to finding a effective balance between security and performance. Traditional and new Security mechanisms should be redesigned to increase their effectiveness in multi-tenancy environments.
\item \textbf{Tenant aware components}.
In scalability and \ac{QoS} research tools like tenant aware load balancers and tenant aware databases are used or proposed.
The benefits of such tools in a multi-tenant environment have already been proven.
However in both the case of the multi-tenant aware database and multi-tenant aware load balancers a lot of work remains to be done.
