Investigating the State of the Art of Multi-Tenancy: a Survey
=============================================================

Multi-tenancy allows multiple organizations to use a single application with their own configuration, on the same system. Despite the fact that many authors have done research on multi-tenancy, no clear definition exists.

In our survey, we research the current state of multi-tenancy. We identified four major software concepts that need extra care or provide extra opportunities in multi-tenant application development: 
security, as the security concerns are holding back adoption of multi-tenancy; 
scalability, as an unscalable application cannot leverage the benefits of the economics of scale; 
quality of service, as performance must be upheld for all active tenants;
and variability, as that is where value is added for tenants. \\ 

Our research agenda provides an overview of possible research opportunities, such as automation (automatic deployment, wizards for tenants), guarantees (solutions to new problems need to be provable) and tenant-aware components (such as load balancers and databases).
