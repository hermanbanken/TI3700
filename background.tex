%% Introduction here

\subsection{Definitions}

Bezemer and Zaidman\cite{bezemer2010multi} describe a tenant as an organizational entity which rents a multi-tenant SaaS solution (usually grouping a number of users). Krebs et al.\cite{krebs2012architecture} have a looser defintion of a tenant; they describe it as a group of users sharing the same view.

Based on these definitions, both more or less agree on the defintion of a multi-tenant application: hardware resource sharing by offering one shared application and database instance to multiple tenants.

The difference between multi-tenancy and multi-user is also made clear by Bezemer and Zaidman. They state that in a multi-user application all users use the same application with limited configuration options. %% elaborate!

Krebs et al. also mention tenant space, which means that customers rent predifined space of resources (example: IaaS).

\subsection{Different layers of multi-tenancy}

%% ...

%% multi-instance = each tenant has own instance of application (and (optionally) database) [Bezemer and Zaidman 2010]

Krebs et al.\cite{krebs2012architecture} describe various layers of sharing:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Sharing a data center (very limited benefits)
\item Virtualization, thus sharing a server (large overhead)
\item Middleware sharing (difficult isolation and overhead)
\item Multi-Tenant Application (MTA)
\end{enumerate}

%% multiple application deployment = multiple applications in one instance of the same runtime environment (is not multi-tenancy!) [Krebs et al. 2012]

\subsection{Multi-tenancy vs. the cloud}

Dillon et al.\cite{dillon2010cloud} comprehensively elaborate on various aspects of cloud services. They mention the following service models: 

\begin{enumerate}
\item Software as a Service (example: Google Mail/Docs)
\item Platform as a Service (example: Google AppEngine)
\item Infrastructure as a Service (example: Amazon EC2)
\item Data as a Service (example: Google BigTable)
\end{enumerate}

Multi-tenancy falls within Software as a Service (SaaS), as mentioned by ... %resource?

They also describe the several essential characteristics of cloud services, including resource pooling and rapid elasticity. These are both challenges for multi-tenant applications, as mentioned by ... %resource?

\subsection{Challenges of multi-tenancy}

The multi-tenancy model has created two new security issues\cite{dillon2010cloud}. Sharing resources on the same physical machine pose a danger to the data of the tenants. This falls within the isolation challenge. Another issue is reputation fate-sharing, since one might be sharing resources with possible criminal users, creating the possibility to (for example) get blacklisted.

Another challenge is the charging model. The costs of developing multi-tenancy can be very substantial for SaaS providers, because they need to re-design or re-develop single-tenancy software, introduce new features for customization and enhance the security.
