%% Introduction here

\subsection{Definitions}

Bezemer and Zaidman\cite{bezemer2010multi} describe a tenant as an organizational entity which rents a multi-tenant SaaS solution (usually grouping a number of users). Krebs et al.\cite{krebs2012architecture} have a looser defintion of a tenant; they describe it as a group of users sharing the same view.

Based on these definitions, both more or less agree on the defintion of a multi-tenant application: hardware resource sharing by offering one shared application and database instance to multiple tenants.

The difference between multi-tenancy and multi-user is also made clear by Bezemer and Zaidman. They state that in a multi-user application all users use the same application with limited configuration options. %% elaborate!

Krebs et al. also mention tenant space, which means that customers rent predifined space of resources (example: IaaS).

\subsection{Different layers of multi-tenancy}

%% ...

%% multi-instance = each tenant has own instance of application (and (optionally) database) [Bezemer and Zaidman 2010]

%% multiple application deployment = multiple applications in one instance of the same runtime environment (is not multi-tenancy!) [Krebs et al. 2012]
